# Project Title

Simple Orders System API

## Description

This RESTful API will be able to execute the 4 HTTP verbs (POST, GET, PUT, DELETE). Also, it'll have support for specific query parameters such as "greaterThan" and a few more. The final objective is to run this application on Cloud Run which is a container-based product from Google Cloud and to create Apigee API proxies for accessing this backend service.
