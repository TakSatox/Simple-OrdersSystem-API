# Project Title

Simple Orders System API

## Description

This RESTful API will be able to execute the 4 HTTP verbs (POST, GET, PUT, DELETE). Also, it'll have support for specific query parameters such as "greaterThan" and a few more. The final objective is creating an API as a product and running this application on Cloud Run which is a container-based product from Google Cloud.
